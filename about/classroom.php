	<p>Stella's Stunners are designed to be tantalizing. At first glance they are daunting, with seemingly insufficient or contradictory information given, or they're simply enormously messy. Their purpose is to go well beyond the routine problems of a course, and to put the students into situations where they do not know what to do. The question, "What do you do when you don't know what to do?" is ever-present, and leads to substantive work with <a href="/background/heuristics.php">heuristics</a>. In the work with the Stunners, students become ever more crafty in their approaches &ndash; their minds wake up &ndash; and the "aha" moments become more and more satisfying.</p>

	<p>Stella's Stunners were a part of my classroom from 1984 until I retired in 2005. The problems were woven in various ways through the courses I taught, depending on the courses and the nature of the students in them. Here's the classic scheme, the ur-scheme, of how I used them.</p>

	<h4>One Way to Go:</h4>
	<p>Imagine a tracked course, with students of ostensibly similar levels of ability and motivation. On Friday I hand out a set of eight problems. The material ranges each week from beginning-level visual puzzles, through arithmetic problems, and on up so that the last two are related to the material from the current course, one from earlier in the course and the other from more-or-less current material.</p>

	<p>I should note here that these problems are assigned entirely on top of the regular course work. Interestingly, the regular progress of the course is not slowed down by the "Stellas", as the kids call them.</p>

	<p>Students are charged with working on the problems with no contact with anyone else, including other students. Each student keeps a notebook. On the following Friday the notebook is due: each problem is cut out from the handout and pasted into the notebook, followed by the written-out solution or partial solution that the student has come up with. I collect the notebooks and pass out the next set of problems. I read the notebooks over the (busy) weekend and hand them back early in the week &ndash; I try for Monday. See below for how I grade the notebooks.</p>

	<p>So the students have had their new problems over the weekend. On Monday we read them through together, just to make sure that everybody understands what each problem is asking for. There's probably no further discussion of any of them that day. Then, as the week goes along, I check in briefly each day to see how things are going. I may give a hint about one or more of them if everybody is stuck, or I may suggest a <a href="/background/heuristics.php">heuristic</a> to try.</p>

	<p>On Friday, the students turn in whatever they've done, get their new problem set, and so it goes. I'd skip the weeks when we had a test, or give extra time.</p>

	<p>One variant of this system, as explained so far, is to permit collaboration among students. But parents are specifically forbidden to help.</p>

	<h4>Grading:</h4>
	<p>The goal is a fair and efficient process.</p>

	<p>Each problem gets from 0 to 4 points for mathematics, and either 0 or 1 for grammar and English usage. I put the scores, along with my often-extensive comments, by each problem in the notebook. Then, to tabulate a math grade, I use Steve Meiring's brilliant point system, as follows. These problems are hard enough that a student getting half of them has done very well. But that's only 50%, which would be failing in a regular percentage system. Steve's system gives, say, 28 points (out of 100) for the first correct solution out of the eight attempts, no matter which problem it is, 20 for the second, 12 for the third, and so on in decreasing order until the last one gives only 2. Thus getting three problems right is 60 points already, and when you're struggling with that last toughie you're only losing 2 points if you can't do it. I make an overall judgment about the spelling and grammar. This sounds complicated and time-consuming for the grader, and I have made up a tiny grading ticket that makes the process efficient. See the illustrations provided. I fill out a ticket for each student's set for the week and tape it in to her notebook.</p>

	<p>Besides the solutions of the problems themselves, I give a few points for pasting in all of the problems whether a solution has been attempted or not, for logging the amount of time spent on the whole set, for listing their collaborators if any, and for writing a "Dear Stella" note commenting on the problems in general and how they felt--good or bad-- about doing them. These comments will range from "I couldn't believe I actually got the third one!" to "Dear Stella, when are you going to die?"</p>

	<p>As mentioned above, I also award points for good grammar and spelling. This score is kept separate from the math score. All in all, there are 100 points available for the math and eight or so for English.</p>

	<p>At the end of the marking period, I usually give the total Stella grade about the same weight as one test. This depends on the type of class that it is, though. If the class is one of limited ability, I say that I'll include the Stella grades only if it would help the overall grade for the marking period.</p>

	<p>I should note that I found it enormously satisfying to have this written back-and-
forth with each student, keeping in touch with both their minds and their feelings.</p>

	<h4>Variations:</h4>
	<p>In an untracked class, such as we have at tiny Oberlin High School, there is a wide range of ability and motivation, with very weak students in the same class with hot-shots. Running a Stella program in those classes was a serious challenge for me, and I am not entirely happy with what I did. I'll describe that first, and then say a bit about what I might have done.</p>

	<h4>What I did:</h4>
	<p>In the first place, I didn't assign as many problems, sometimes even only two. I would try to find particularly interesting or outrageous problems to pose. I would give more time in class for discussing them and teasing out possible approaches, and then on Thursday we would actually solve at least one of them as a class if necessary, and for particularly weak students I would write a full solution on the board that they could copy and use for their write-up. The hope was that the more talented and motivated students would be finding their own solutions. Many of my students could hardly write a coherent sentence on their own, and I had to believe that the process of copying out a logical argument helped them. But the top students didn't get the push they deserved, no doubt of that.</p>

	<h4>What I wish I'd done:</h4>
	<p>I would like to have told the class that doing well on all of the regular work of the course, including the minimal Stella program as described above, was enough to earn a B in the course. Any student wishing to get an A would need to do the Stella program in the classic sense, all eight problems, etc. This is sort of like using Stellas for extra credit, except that the grading structure made it a requirement for the top students. What held me back from that, I guess, is that I never dealt with how to find class time for the discussion of the hard problems since not all of the students were working on them.</p>

	<p>What's coming on stage here is the general problem of differentiated instruction in an untracked class. I was never very good at it, particularly with regard to the enormously diverse ability/motivation levels in math classes at OHS that resulted from the ever-increasing graduation requirements.</p>

	<p>In whatever way they manifested themselves, Stella and her Stunners were a strong presence within the student body, a known part of the curriculum, outrageous, crazy, and demanding, that everybody suffered through, with generally buoyant feeling. There were several years when the problems were part of every math class taught by anybody; I'd sometimes recruit the dazzling brainy cheerleaders to come into my freshman class to help the star-struck beginners. By the time I retired I was the only teacher using them, at this reduced level of intensity. I was sad about this, because students from the 80's would come back for reunions and tell me "Stella got me into law school," "Stella got me high marks on the SAT's," so forth. I'm not at all sure that by the end there was enough voltage in the way I was using the Stunners so that recent graduates could say the same.</p>
