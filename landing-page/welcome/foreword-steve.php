  <p>What better way to introduce you to the world of <span style="font-style: italic">Stella’s Stunners</span> than
    to let you know at the outset you have entered a realm where the usual
    rules of learning seem not always to apply. Somehow, you found your way to
    this website, presumably because you have a strong interest in problem
    solving. Or perhaps your arrival here is motivated by the desire to
    stimulate deeper and more thoughtful mathematical interactions for your
    students through good problems. If so, you have come to the right
    location.</p>

  ">This introductory essay is an electronic orientation for what you can
    expect to find here and to provoke your desire to explore all that is to
    be discovered.</p>

  <p>To start: A <span style="font-style: italic">Stunner</span> is a non-routine problem like the following:</p>

  <img src="foreword-steve-pic2.jpg" alt="A 2-pan balance with 4 brass
  weights sitting in front of it." style="float: right; width: 25%">

  <p style="padding: 2%">Ignacio runs the Zaragoza Deli in New York City. He has a 2-pan
    balance and a set of 4 brass weights. He can weigh out any whole number
    of ounces up to 40 using just these weights. What is the amount of each
    brass weight? (Weights are used in any combination on either or both pans of
    the scale.)</p>

  <p>Problems provide the medium for exchanging ideas in mathematics. The
    better the problems, the more intriguing are discussions and discoveries
    that prompt the thinking that leads to solution ‒ as well as implications
    for how that thinking is directed toward other problems. Even more compelling
    are discoveries we make about our own thinking processes, and how we are
    changed by the experience of confronting good problems.</p>

  <p>Being human, we react to challenges in which we invest time. Our
    reactions might be relief at being finished, elation at success, self-doubt
    for admitting failure, enlightenment of discovery, agitation because the
    result was not worth the effort, or myriad other emotions unique to the
    individual. The most important reaction occurs when a problem takes on a
    life of its own. The solution search no longer driven by someone else’s
    direction, it becomes a personal drive for understanding and reflection. </p>

  <p>The point is that interesting, fanciful, challenging problems command our
    attention over an appreciable time span, and in the process become
    memorable. Good problems fascinate us; they provoke intriguing
    conversations; and they tag along as unbidden companions as we go about
    other activities. Once the challenge of a good problem has gotten hold of you,
    you can’t let it go. <span style="font-style: italic">Stunners</span> make mathematics a more fun activity in which
    to become personally invested to learn.</p>

  <p>In that context, this site is a repository of more than 700 such problems,
    assembled by now retired teacher Rudd Crawford, over the course of a long
    teaching career, which started in Concord, Massachusetts and which ended in
    the small Ohio college town of Oberlin. Used with students for much of his
    teaching career, these non-routine problems brought a new sense of purpose
    to his students’ learning and, in the process, helped to enrich the
    traditional program.</p>

  <p>Of consequence to you, this problem collection is offered as a
    professional service. Problems are free for the taking. The collection is
    organized by course, by title, by topic, and into problem sets used by Rudd
    and his Oberlin HS colleagues to nurture student problem solving on a
    recurring basis. One of many features of this site is a selection basket
    for which the web visitor can choose particular sets of 6-8 problems from
    the collection itself or self-select individual problems, assemble, and
    print out a personalized problem set. More about these organizational
    features in the section, <span style="font-style: italic">The Problem Library.</span> </p>

  <h2>An Odyssey of Teaching Discovery</h2>

  <p>Accompanying the <span style="font-style: italic">Stella</span> collection is a series of short essays written by
    Rudd in his authentic and understated teaching style. These essays are
    found under the Post-It sections Using the Library with Students and
    Everything Else. The essays tell a story of the discoveries made by a
    classroom teacher, eventually leading to how to use <span style="font-style: italic">Stellas</span> (student name
    for <span style="font-style: italic">Stunners</span>) to complement the normal fare of textbook learning. </p>

  <p>The story begins in the late 1960s with Rudd making the discovery that
    his personal affection for brain-teaser problems, and small collection on
    note cards, could be used with a student when nothing else seemed to work.
    In <span style="font-style: italic">How I Got Started</span>, we learn how this notion stayed with him into the
    1970s, whereupon he confronted junior high school students who were bright,
    but bored, with the customary textbook work. Once again, he found that
    learners flourished in an environment liberally sprinkled with non-routine
    problems. </p>

  <p>When they (and he) eventually reached the high school together, those same
    students clamored, “We haven’t done anything hard in math since middle school
    – give us some more of those problems.” This impetus and a student named
    Solomon caused Rudd to begin pondering. That pondering led to how to offer a
    new, problem-solving dimension within the framework of traditional learning –
    practically, instructionally, and programmatically. It also led Rudd to think
    deeply about the nature of mathematics, how students learn it, and how they
    are shaped by that learning.</p>

  <p>In the essay, <span style="font-style: italic">Stella’s Biography</span> we make the acquaintance of Stella, an older
    and eccentric Dutch baroness − friend to Rudd and, up to the time of her
    death, a consultant to the Oberlin HS math department. Among her many
    eccentricities was a penchant for carrying around vexing problems in her
    leather purse until they were solved, and even after, in a sort of
    celebration. Stella became the source of the stunners visited upon students.
    She also served as a model for students of a mathematician who relishes the
    challenge of good problems and who will persist with them until they are
    vanquished.</p>

  <p><span style="font-style: italic">Stella in My Classroom</span> recounts how <span style="font-style: italic">Stellas</span> came to be offered in sets of 6-8
    problems considered independently by students over the course of the calendar
    week − besides regular coursework. By week’s end, solutions and student
    thoughts about the stunners were recorded in their notebooks and turned in for
    comments and grading. This essay further describes how students came to
    understand that <span style="font-style: italic">heuristics</span> arise naturally as what one does when you don’t
    even know how to start on a problem. </p>

  <p>The section on grading is a concession to the reality that a ‘good’
    performance on any problem set is about half the problems solved. It also
    presents an alternative scheme (and philosophy) for how to evaluate problem
    solving in a way that is constructive and not self-defeating. </p>

  <h2>The Argument for <span style="font-style: italic">Stellas</span></h2>

  <p>Perhaps the most important essays about teaching discovery are <span style="font-style: italic">What Students
      Learn from Problem Solving</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">Feedback from Former Students</span>. “What Students
    Learn …” is an insightful look at the purpose for learning mathematics as
    measured against how we typically go about it. Implied without it being stated
    is this generalization: we usually learn mathematics, lesson after lesson, in
    a manner that depends upon the teacher to predigest the material for us, to
    work out sample problems, and then to assign exercises that coincidentally
    happen to fit the lesson just taught. When difficulties are encountered,
    students are encouraged to quickly seek help. The pared down problems and
    exercises are mostly bereft of the contexts that often make problems more
    interesting.</p>

  <p>This kind of a lesson is efficient for learning lots of mathematics and to
    automate the skills, ideas, and processes to be acquired. Doing so frees up
    the mind to learn new things the next day. The limitation is that the
    knowledge acquired is customarily at an introductory level. It is not
    immediately integrated into a deeper and well-connected hierarchy of
    understanding that makes that knowledge quickly and easily accessible to
    address new problems presented in a different context. Consider, for example,
    this problem:</p>

  <p style="padding: 2%">A chicken and a half lays an egg and a half in a day and a half. How many
    eggs will 12 chickens lay in 12 days?</p>

  <p>It is safe to say that most secondary students are not very good at solving
    such a whimsical problem. The question is Why not? And what does that tell us
    about the relative accessibility of their learning?</p>

  <p>One answer is that dispositions the student brings to the task influence her
    chances for success. Students are accustomed by daily lessons to think of math
    as a task or situation you identify as something recognized, for which you
    recall from memory an appropriate technique for solution. This preconception
    applied to the above problem presents a conundrum. It is not recognizable.
    Habituated to dispatching such a task quickly and routinely, you take a
    superficial ‘swipe’ at solution, multiplying the information in the first
    sentence through by 2/3 . Eventually, you arrive at the incorrect answer of
    12, or a more reasonable, yet still wrong result of 144.</p>

  <p>Missing in this pedagogical sequence is the opportunity for students to learn
    <span style="font-style: italic">HOW</span> to address situations for which they have not been explicitly taught. This
    goal entails learning the type of heuristic thinking and learning skills
    necessary to apply what you understand to something new. <span style="font-style: italic">Stellas</span> offer that
    opportunity in the equivalent of a ‘virtual lab,’ where the emphasis is on
    thinking your way through to a solution, rather than the mechanics or elegance
    of the solution steps. <span style="font-style: italic">Stellas</span> provide a new and complementary dimension to
    textbook-style learning.</p>

  <p><span style="font-style: italic">Extending Problems</span> raises two other considerations for <span style="font-style: italic">Stellas</span>. First, good
    problems often beget other good problems to solve. Take the example of the
    balance problem above. Why are the required weights all powers of 3? This is a
    suitable problem for students and teacher alike.</p>

  <p>Extending problems provides an opportunity for the Stella strand and regular
    coursework to intersect. A Stella problem can foreshadow a textbook lesson to
    come, or it can revisit a previous topic learned, but in a different way. For
    example, the chicken-and-egg problem could be identified as an extension of
    direct variation. Suppose the student begins by exploring the problem and
    mulls, “If I double the number of chickens, what should happen to the number
    of eggs produced?” This quickly leads to a method of solution for building up
    the ratios until the required condition is met. This is an illustration of
    using Stella problems to revisit previously learned ideas and to extend
    students’ understanding.</p>

  <p>After the chicken problem has been considered, perhaps now recognized as a
    direct variation of two independent variables, it sets the stage for a
    subsequent textbook lesson on compound variation. In the midst of that
    discussion, the teacher can innocently pose this question, “Where have you
    seen an example of a compound variation that depends on two independent
    variables and a constant rate?” One answer (i = P ∙ r ∙ t) presents another
    avenue for solution to the chicken-and-egg problem as well as a connection
    to a taught schema for solving a class of problems.</p>

  <p>Next, we come to the essay on <span style="font-style: italic">Feedback from Former Students</span>. As modern
    research will attest, emotions often influence how we think as much as do our
    reasoning skills. What we believe to be true (whether a problem can be solved
    by us), what we think is an appropriate learning task (is it fair to ask me to
    start out not knowing what to do), and what importance we assign to a task
    (our passion to persist in spite of adversity) are direct measures of how much
    of our sense of self and our intellectual resources we will commit to the
    task. </p>

  <p><span style="font-style: italic">Stellas</span> present a learning environment in which the rules of engagement are
    identified upfront as different from textbook exercises. By definition,
    <span style="font-style: italic">Stellas</span> are hard; you are expected to persist over a period of time; and not
    knowing how to proceed is a given. Sometimes you get the problem; and
    sometimes the problem gets you. Students are encouraged (and expected) to
    express their feelings in their writeups about <span style="font-style: italic">Stellas</span> and themselves after
    they have emerged from the experience of tackling something that is mentally
    challenging.</p>

  <h2>The Gestalt of <span style="font-style: italic">Stellas</span></h2>

  <p>Science education as a discipline has long had a handle on a unifying
    principle they define as <span style="font-style: italic">scientific inquiry</span>. In a nutshell, it means that
    science has adopted the notion that for students to learn science
    appropriately, they sometimes must have opportunities where they must think
    like scientists:</p>

  <p style="padding: 2%">Inquiry means that students are handling science; they are manipulating it,
    working it into new shapes and formats, integrating it into every corner of
    their world, and playing with it in unknown ways. Inquiry implies that
    students are in control of an important part of their own learning where they
    can manipulate ideas to increase understanding. As students learn to think
    through the designs and developments of their own inquiry, they also develop a
    sense of self-responsibility that transcends all subject areas.</p>

  <p> What Rudd’s Stella strand provides are opportunities for students to apply
    what they have learned and sometimes to discover mathematics as it was
    created. They have the occasional chance to act like mathematicians in the
    virtual laboratory world of <span style="font-style: italic">Stellas</span>. That experience changes them in the way
    in which they think. They learn habits for learning like Persistence,
    Resilience, Focusing over time, Flexibility, Curiosity, and Love of subject
    matter.</p>

  <p>As quotes from Crawford’s former students attest: <span style="font-style: italic">Stellas</span> taught them more
    than just how to do and how to learn mathematics. <span style="font-style: italic">Stellas</span> taught them how to
    apply their minds generally.</p>


  <p>In looking over the various essays and problems that comprise <span style="font-style: italic">Stella’s
      Stunners</span>, one is struck by several things. One, none of us gets smart all at
    once – students or the teacher. It took the better part of a teaching career
    for Rudd to refine the Stunners you will find here and the teaching
    methodologies that support them. At each and every turn in the essays, you
    find illustrations of teaching methods that are dead on. </p>

  <p>For example, problems were given out as sets rather than individually (a
    <span style="font-style: italic">Stella</span> used as a class toss-up question primarily benefits the solver).
    Assigned sets were constructed to give every student a chance to participate
    and some measure of success. Sets worked on over a span of days enabled
    students to learn what persistence looks like and how their minds work when
    given time and sufficient focus. He employed an evaluation scheme that
    validated the importance of the work and that assigned credit in a
    constructive way that valued alternative approaches. </p>

  <p>He created a safe environment where students could struggle and meet success
    or failure in applying their knowledge, knowing that they were not competing
    against everyone else, but only against what they themselves were capable.
    Requiring formal writeups of problems taught students how to do a technical
    report. Stella, herself, was a model for student expectations as well as the
    nemesis toward whom students could focus their vexations.</p>


  <p>None of this came about easily nor quickly. In one sense, Rudd had to
    practice what he expected of his students. Just as they had to learn how to
    learn differently, he had to learn how to think differently about teaching. He
    started slow. He experimented with better students first. He learned how to
    adapt and to adjust to what worked and what didn’t. He talked with other
    colleagues who were interested in the same things. This is one more serious
    piece of advice for you, the reader, in experimenting with these materials.</p>


  <p>But mostly, the essays are a story of a love affair among a teacher, his
    students, and challenging, quirky math problems. One doesn’t put that much
    energy and time into something requiring this degree of hard work and
    creativity without loving what you are doing. That same affection for his
    profession and for what good teaching should aspire to has led to this
    resource of <span style="font-style: italic">Stellas</span> made available to you, the website visitor.</p>
