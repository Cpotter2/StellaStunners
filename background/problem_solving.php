	<p>The point of studying mathematics is to become fluent at thinking mathematically, i.e. the ability to use the power of mathematics in personally meaningful ways to achieve some end. Solving problems -- many of them -- is the means for acquiring this know-how. We can say that problem solving is to learning mathematics content as essay writing is to learning grammar. Knowing mathematical formulas, say, is at the same level as understanding good sentence structure; they are both, merely, powerful tools that shouldn't be thought as ends in themselves.</p>

	<p>We differentiate between problems and exercises. Exercises are simply practice at skills: solving equations, solving triangles by using the Pythagorean theorem or the law of cosines, and so forth. Exercises are straightforward. Problems -- "word problems" -- as found in textbooks, also tend to be direct, straightforward applications of recently-learned skills to ostensibly real-world situations.</p>

	<p>The problems that we consider in the Stella project should best be labelled as non-routine problems. These are problems that are presented with no hints as to what methods or skills will be needed to solve them. They may seem to have insufficient given information....***Finish this later, maybe ask Rudd to edit it more b/c it could use some more work.***</p>
