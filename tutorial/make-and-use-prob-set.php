	<p>In an effort to make it easy for you to provide problems for your students, we have made eighteen suggested sets of problems, listed in the dark area to the left of your screen.  Within each of the eighteen sets, we have
    made a problem subset for each of five imagined courses: pre-algebra, algebra I, geometry, algebra II/trigonometry, and pre-calculus mathematics.  Each of these subsets
    contains between 5 and 8 problems.  (Thus each of the eighteen sets contains between twenty-five and forty problems, most usually thirty-five.)</p>

  <p>To see any of the eighteen sets, just click on it. To see a subset for some course:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Click on <strong>Filter</strong> and choose one of the first five tags on the drop-down menu. These
correspond to particular courses.</li>
    <li>Click <strong>Add Tag.</strong></li>
    <li>Choose a <strong>Problem Set</strong>.  Each set contains a variety of problems, which become
more challenging as the set number increases.</li>
    <li>Click on the red box: "Create a document with these problems".</li>
    <li>Write a <strong>title</strong> for your set in the box at the top. Click "<strong>Make Document</strong>" (the box at
the bottom).</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Your browser will download a pdf.</p>

  <p>BUT! If you want to edit the set before you make the PDF for it, here’s what to do. To
add a problem, you need to know its Stella number (or its title). We suggest opening up
a second screen to find the problem you want, while keeping the set itself at the ready.
Then go into the red box if you weren’t already there. To add a problem, do the usual
thing of typing in its number (or title) and hit “Add Problem”. Removing a problem is
easy, as you can see. Once this is done and you like your list, continue with Make
Document. Don’t forget to create a title for it!</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

  <p>There are no problems that appear in more than one problem set.  You could give your students Stellas for five years, using the problem sets, and they would
    never see the same problem twice!  (But, thus, if you edit a problem set and stick in something else, you might find it turning up in another set later. The green tags that
    you’ll see with the problems will tip you off about this. Be ye warned.)</p>

  <p>These directions assume that you want a set of 6 to 8 problems for a particular course
(five to choose from). If you want to see all the problems in a particular set—for all five
courses at once, skip steps 1 and 2. If you want to see all of the problems for one
course—say, Algebra—for the entire 18 sets, skip steps 1 and 2 and click on "Algebra"
under Courses.</p>

  <p>The tags: each problem comes with three green tags, indicating the set that it’s in, the course that it’s in, and what kind of a problem it is (among the 13 overall topics).</p>

  <p>The introductory problems are discussed under their own link under the BROWSING
post-it.</p>

  <p>About set 99: these are problems that aren't in any of the 18 official problem sets.  This is where we add more problems that we find.
    If you send us nifty problems of your own to add to the library (hint, hint), this is where they'll go.</p>

  <p>Why eighteen problem sets?  The idea is to give you enough to get you through the school year if you use one every two weeks or so. We have tried to arrange the content of
    these problem sets to coordinate, more or less, with the material being taught as the year goes along.</p>
